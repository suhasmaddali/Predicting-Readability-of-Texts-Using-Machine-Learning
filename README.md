# Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning

There are many articles that are being produced everyday. There are books from different authors being produced. As a result, we see text all around us and there is a lot to do with the text. Since there are more and more books and articles being produced everyday, it becomes important that one uses the text information and understand them so that they would be able to make the best use of it. 

There are texts of different difficulty levels being created and there could be different age groups exposed to these texts. Sometimes a high difficulty text might be given to a child who is just about 10 years of age. On the contrary, a low difficulty text might be given to a highly educated individual who might easily understand the text that lacks much knowledge. Therefore, it becomes important to understand and predict the readability of the text and the difficulty associated with it so that different level texts could be given to different individuals based on their difficulty respectively. 

With machine learning and deep learning, it is possible to predict the readability of the text and understand some of the important features that determine the difficulty respectively. There are different features that we have to take into consideration and the more we are learning the machine learning models, the better we are going to get in the long term. We are sure to understand some of the important parameters and we are learning the things that we are sure that we are going to be getting in the long term. We are sure that the more we are learning the machine learning tools, the better we are going to get in the long term. Understanding the text and working on some important parameters are some of the important things that we are going ot make sure that we are learning in the long term. 
Therefore, we have to consider a few important parameters when determining the difficulty of different machine learning models respectively. We have to take into consideration the difficulty of the text along with other important features such as the number of syllables and the difficulty of the words in order to determine the overall level of the text.
